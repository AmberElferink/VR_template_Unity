Open the Unity project and click the SampleScene in Assets > Scenes.

When hitting play you should be able to see your hands as blocks in VR and should be able to move them around as usual. The controls are implemented via OpenVR, so should be compatible with any headset (HTC, Valve, Windows Mixed Reality, Oculus) compatible with that.

No further interactions (grab/teleport/walking) are in this simulation.
